2022-06-10

2021-11-29
    Fixed precision problem with RMSD calculations.

2021-11-27
    Code fixes to pass less forgiving compilers.

2013-05-08
    Rewrote codes for computing RMSD.

2012-08-20
    1. Support for silent file input.
    2. Decoy files are loaded into memory by default; disk bound access is
reverted to when the number of files exceeds PreloadedPDB::ADVISED_THRESHOLD,
or when user specifies it ("-d").

2012-01-17
    Added two improvements to the program due to Jared Adolf-Bryfogle (Drexel
College of Medicine). It is now possible to specify the chains to use for
clustering. (Previously, Calibur uses only the chains 'A', 'C', and ' ' in
constructing the structures for clustering.) Similarly, the restriction can be
specified as a range of C-alpha atoms, e.g. from the 51th to the 109th C-alpha
atom. Please run "calibur" without any commandline argument for the details.

2009-08-13
    Initial public release.
